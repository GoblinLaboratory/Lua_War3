Description:
This example shows how to generate TLB's with the Luacom extended API. The
API is undocumented, and can change in future releases. The Microsoft IDL
compiler (MIDL) must be in your path.

Files:
  - idltest.lua: generates a sample type library.
  - register.lua: generates a type library and implements a COM object
    from it.
